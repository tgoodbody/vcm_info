They do not have title to agrarian rights, cannot vote in assemblies, and in cases cannot participate in decision making, but do have a voice in the assembly process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Safeguard (SS)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSS8 Proper Notification\nEach Forest Owner should describe how notices of Assemblies take place to include as many people as possible.\n\n\nSS9 Participation\nAssemblies must provide a sign-in sheet for attendance monitoring.

The Project Coordinator should be included in all Forest Project monitoring, reporting, and verification processes.\n\n\nSS13 Term of a Project Coordinator\nThe length of the term of Project Coordinator must be defined in the Project Report.  The Project Report must identify whether the position of Project Coordinator can be renewed and, if so, for how many terms.\n\n\nSS14 Replacing the Project Coordinator\nTo address potential disputes associated with the Project Coordinator and/or Forest Project, a dispute resolution process and process to replace the Project Coordinator from the position (which should take place during an Assembly) must be documented in the Project Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Safeguards\nEnvironmental safeguards ensure that Forest Projects sustain and/or enhance forest ecosystem functions. The environmental safeguards are established by activity to take into consideration the different forest ecosystems and land cover types present within different Activity Areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Safeguard (ES)\nApplicable Activities\nActivity Area Guidance\n\n\n\n\nES1 Maintenance of forest carbon stocks\nAll\nActivity Areas must maintain or increase standing live and dead carbon stocks over the project life, as determined by a running 10-year average of carbon stocks within the Activity Areas. Exceptions may be granted by the Reserve.\n\n\nES2 Native Species\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation\nMust demonstrate progress towards achieving 95% native species within the Activity Areas. Use of native species outside historic range allowed if used as climate change adaptation strategy with SEMARNAT office approval.  - IFM/Restoration: 50 years  - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment.\n\n\nES3 Composition of Native Species\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation\nMust demonstrate progress towards meeting native species composition according to Table 3.3. Exceptions allowed with regional SEMARNAT or CONABIO approval.  - IFM/Restoration: 50 years  - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment.\n\n\nES4 Maintenance or increase of tree canopy cover\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation, Agroforestry, Silvopastoral\nTree canopy cover must not decrease due to human activities. Verify at 6th reporting period. Decline &gt;5% due to negligence results in corrective action. Approved activities planned by government agencies are exempt.\n\n\nES5 Sustainable harvesting practices\nIFM\nHarvest areas &gt;5 hectares must retain 10% of trees in groups no further than 100 meters from other trees. Retained trees not felled until 10 years old. Exceptions require prior written request approval.\n\n\nES6 Maintenance of natural land cover\nReforestation\nConsider effects on ecological processes. Provide justification for activities impacting natural land cover for Reserve approval.\n\n\nES7 Soil disturbance during site preparation for tree planting\nAll\nSite preparation using deep ripping prohibited from affecting &gt;1% of Activity Area. If exceeded, reporting for the Activity Area is suspended for three periods.  Example: Deep ripping on 100-hectare area affects 22,000 meters with tine width of 0.1 meters, affecting 2.24% of area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nActivty area size determines native species composition requirments:\n\n10ha - single species allowed\n10-50ha - 90% single species\n50-100ha - 80% single species, 2 other species required\n100-1000ha - 70% single species, 3 other species required\n&gt; 1000ha - 60% single species, 4 other species required\n\n\n\n\nForest Types\n\nNatural forest and shrub land cover (bosque, selva, zonas áridas) are where dominant overstory vegetation is comprised of an overwhelming majority of native species, i.e., greater than 70% by CO2e stocking.\nNatural grassland areas are where grassland plant communities (native or non-native species) exist due to natural environmental features (soil conditions, precipitation, etc.) and/or natural frequency of disturbance events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the grasslands must be constantly grazed or burned more frequently than would be the case in a natural ecosystem, the grasslands would not meet the definition of natural.\n\n\n\nWetlands are considered natural wherever they are found not being used for agriculture or intensive aquaculture and not part of a non-natural waterbody.\n\n\n\n\nStart Date\nThe project start date cannot be more than 1 year prior to the submittal date and must be able to demonstrate project activities initiated on the claimed date through verifiable action or event. Permissable actions include:\n\nAn Assembly where commencent of training or analysis for the project were approved - provided to the verifier with an official Assembly Act form, meeting notes, agenda.\nProject submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAddition of subsequent Activity Areas is based on official approval and inclusion of these areas in the annual MRV documents.\n\n\n\n\nCrediting Period\nTwo crediting period lengths (durability commitments) are permitted:\n\n30 Years\n100 Years\n\nProjects with a 30-year crediting pecriod that have met all Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirements and maintained legal compliance throughout their first crediting period, can extend the crediting period for another 30-year period using the baseline developed for the initial crediting period.\n\nMinimum Time Commitment\nProjects must commit to maintaining carbon sequestered due to project activities for a minimum period of 30 years up to the Reserve’s 100-year permanence requirement. However, for projects that commit to a period less than 100 years, credits will be issued in an amount proportionate to the length of the commitment relative to 100 years."
