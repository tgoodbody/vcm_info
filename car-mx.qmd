    Climate Action Reserve Mexico Forest Protocol - Simplified Overview
---

# Overview

![](img/project_workflow.jpg)

__Forest Project__: a planned set of defined activities designed to increase removals of CO2e from the atmosphere through increasing forest carbon stocks on the communal lands of ejidos or communities, private lands, or public lands.

__Project Area__: all areas within an ownership, held either communally, privately, or publicly, in which project activities within _Activity Areas_ may occur as part of the project, currently or in the future.

* Communally owned lands - PA must include all communcal ownership at project start.
* _dominio pleno_ (full ownership rights) parcels should be excluded from PA
* _ejidial_ (communal) parcels converted to _dominio pleno_ should be removed and project re-verified
* Define boundaries using a high resolution map that includes
    * major towns, roads, water
    * Geospatial file (`.shp`,`.kml`,`.geojson`)

![](img/project_activity_areas.jpg)

__Reporting Period__: a period of time for which a Forest Owner quantifies and reports GHG removals (i.e., the length of time covered by the annual CMW) and submits monitoring reports for all required annual monitoring elements. A required duration of 12 months, with the exception of the first reporting period.

## Activities

Mexico Forest Protocol will register activities for sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks, adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

:::{.callout-note}
Management actions may change over the course of the Activity Area’s life, the activity designation is based on the activity definition that is met at the Activity Area’s initiation.
:::


| Activities                    | Definition                                                                       | Activity Area Criteria                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agroforestry and Silvopastoral**| Integration of trees into non-tree crop and animal farming systems               | May be developed within protected areas if activities are not prohibited by management plan. Agricultural product may be included. |
| **Improved Forest Management (IFM)** | Enhances sequestration and resiliency of sequestered carbon                     | Primary land cover is forest, present in varying densities and sizes, forest has management program.             |
| **Reforestation**                 | Direct planting of native tree seedlings or site preparation activities          | Occurs on landscapes that have not been forested for the past 5 years or have been impacted by natural disturbance. |
| **Restoration**                   | Increases carbon stocks and canopy cover on degraded natural forests             | Eligible in any natural forest, must follow management program, not due to legal or regulatory impediment.       |

## Eligibility

The protocol is applicable to forest projects anyhere in mexico so long as they meet the other eligibility criteria.

### Documentation

The Reserve requires data transparency for all Forest Projects, including data that displays current carbon stocks, reversals, and verified GHG removals, as well as verification reports. For this reason, all non-confidential project data reported to the Reserve will be publicly available on the Reserve’s registry.

![](img/document_requirements.jpg)

### Forest Owner
Forest owners are the entity that has undisputed legal ownership of or jurisdiction over the forest carbon through outright ownership or through rights granted to them from a state or federal entity

The forest owner is responsible for undertaking a forest project and registering the project with CAR, and for all reporting. They can consult a project developer to assist with project implementation, but are ultuimately responsible for the project's accuracy and completeness.

::: {.callout-note}
Ownership can be private, communal (e.g. ejidos), or public.

#### Attestations

1. **Attestation of title** must be formally provided to indicate that the owner has exclusive owenership claim to the GHG removals achived by their project over the verification period.

2. **Attestation of No Conflicts** must be formally provided prior to each verification declaring that there are no disputes, claims, or lawsuits related to the property.

For all ejidos and communities, the Forest Owner must submit a document produced by the Agrarian Attorney (Procuraduría Agraria) that states that there are no agrarian conflicts within the Activity Areas as part of the Project Report.

3. **Attestation of Regulatory Compliance** must be signed prior to each verification to indicate that the proejct is in complieance with laws, bylaws, regulations and norms relavant to the project activity.

### Project Developer

A project developer may be the Forest Owner or an independent third-party contracted by the Forest Owner to assist the Forest Owner and implement the Forest Project. Non compliance must be delared in writing - Climate reserve tonnes (credits) will not be issued for GHG removals that occurred for the monitoring period in which the material non-compliance occurred

### Aggregation

The goal of aggregation is to alleviate transaction costs for individual landowners and maintain standards and high-quality offsets. The aggregator may be a corporation or other legally constituted entity, city, county, state agency, individual or a combination thereof, which may then submit documentation on behalf of Aggregate participants (two or more Forest Owners).

Individual project activities can be combined with others to reduce administrative costs, improve marketing opportunities, and enable economies of scale.

::: {.callout-note}
An Aggregate is two or more individual Forest Projects and may be composed of any combination of eligible Forest Owners from any geographic location within Mexico.
:::

Aggregation only applies to:

* Projects with < 10,000 ha of activity areas
* Individual registration and signatory must be performed, including buffer pool assessments.
* Reversal liability lies with individual forest owners

### Social Safeguards

Forest Projects can create long-term climate benefits as well as other social and environmental benefits. Investment into forest carbon projects has the potential to improve quality of life for rural communities, both in terms of increased revenues and in terms of sustaining and improving forest ecosystems.

The social safeguard requirements for ejidos and communities include: 

1. [Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}
    - Make information available to the community about holding an assembly (highest ejido/community body where decisions are made) to discuss social safeguards

### Environmental Safeguards

Environmental safeguards ensure that Forest Projects sustain and/or enhance forest ecosystem functions. The environmental safeguards are established by activity to take into consideration the different forest ecosystems and land cover types present within different Activity Areas.

| Environmental Safeguard (ES)   | Applicable Activities                   | Activity Area Guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ES1 Maintenance of forest carbon stocks** | All                                     | Activity Areas must maintain or increase standing live and dead carbon stocks over the project life, as determined by a running 10-year average of carbon stocks within the Activity Areas. Exceptions may be granted by the Reserve.                                                |
| **ES2 Native Species**             | IFM, Restoration, Reforestation         | Must demonstrate progress towards achieving 95% native species within the Activity Areas. Use of native species outside historic range allowed if used as climate change adaptation strategy with SEMARNAT office approval. <br> - IFM/Restoration: 50 years <br> - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment. |
| **ES3 Composition of Native Species** | IFM, Restoration, Reforestation         | Must demonstrate progress towards meeting native species composition according to Table 3.3. Exceptions allowed with regional SEMARNAT or CONABIO approval. <br> - IFM/Restoration: 50 years <br> - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment.                    |
| **ES4 Maintenance or increase of tree canopy cover** | IFM, Restoration, Reforestation, Agroforestry, Silvopastoral | Tree canopy cover must not decrease due to human activities. Verify at 6th reporting period. Decline >5% due to negligence results in corrective action. Approved activities planned by government agencies are exempt.                                                              |

If exceeded, reporting for the Activity Area is suspended for three periods. <br> Example: Deep ripping on 100-hectare area affects 22,000 meters with tine width of 0.1 meters, affecting 2.24% of area. |

::: {.callout-note}
Activty area size determines native species composition requirments:

*   10ha - single species allowed
*   10-50ha - 90% single species 
*   50-100ha - 80% single species, 2 other species required
*   100-1000ha - 70% single species, 3 other species required
*   \> 1000ha - 60% single species, 4 other species required 
:::

#### Forest Types

1. **Natural forest and shrub land cover (bosque, selva, zonas áridas)** are where dominant overstory vegetation is comprised of an overwhelming majority of native species, i.e., greater than 70% by CO2e stocking.
2. **Natural grassland areas** are where grassland plant communities (native or non-native species) exist due to natural environmental features (soil conditions, precipitation, etc.) and/or natural frequency of disturbance events. 

::: {.callout-note}
If the grasslands must be constantly grazed or burned more frequently than would be the case in a natural ecosystem, the grasslands would not meet the definition of natural.
:::

3. **Wetlands** are considered natural wherever they are found not being used for agriculture or intensive aquaculture and not part of a non-natural waterbody.

### Start Date

The project start date cannot be more than 1 year prior to the submittal date and must be able to demonstrate project activities initiated on the claimed date through verifiable action or event. Permissable actions include:

1. An Assembly where commencent of training or analysis for the project were approved - provided to the verifier with an official Assembly Act form, meeting notes, agenda.
2. Project submission

::: {.callout-note}
Addition of subsequent Activity Areas is based on official approval and inclusion of these areas in the annual MRV documents.
:::

### Crediting Period

Two crediting period lengths (durability commitments) are permitted:

1. 30 Years
2. 100 Years

Projects with a 30-year crediting pecriod that have met all Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirements and maintained legal compliance throughout their first crediting period, can extend the crediting period for another 30-year period using the baseline developed for the initial crediting period.

#### Minimum Time Commitment
Projects must commit to maintaining carbon sequestered due to project activities for a minimum period of 30 years up to the Reserve’s 100-year permanence requirement. However, for projects that commit to a period less than 100 years, credits will be issued in an amount proportionate to the length of the commitment relative to 100 years.

## Additionality

Projects must yield GHG removals that are determined to be additonal to what would have opccured in the absense of a project.Projects must pass the following 2 tests to be considered additional:

1. Legal - GHG removals must be greater than that required by any applicable laws/rules/statutes.
    - IFM - Demonstrate that actual forest growth exceeds allowable harvest from a management plan. Any non-harvested periodic growth is addtional.
    - Reforestation - Was not forest within past 5 years
    - Restoration - Risk to forest inventories are present at considerable levels

2. Performance Standard - GHG removals must be greater than buisiness as usual activities

Direct/indirect investments are required for a project to be considered additional:

1. Reforestation/Agroforestry
    - Direct - labour / capital (seedlings, planting, planning, site prep.)
    - Indirect - protecting established stands from herbivory, land conversion to grazing / agrilculture
2. IFM / Urban forestry
    - Direct - stockign improvements, opportunty costs assocaited with extended rotations
    - Indirect - protection of stands from biotic/abiotic/manmade risks (e.g. illegal harvest)


## GHG Assessment

### Assessment Boundary

__GHG Assessment Boundary__: encompasses all the GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs (SSR) that may be significantly affected by Forest Project activities, including forest carbon stocks, sources of biological CO2 emissions, and GHG emissions from mobile combustion.

### Secondary Effect Sources, Sinks, and Reservoirs

> Unintended changes in carbon stocks, GHG emissions or removals caused by the Forest Project

::: {.callout-note}
Environmental safeguards assure that activities do not result in increased forest carbon emissions. Secondary effects could include CO~2~ emissions associated with site preparation and activity shifting leakage.

| 15  | **Biological GHG emissions or removals from changes in timber harvesting on forestland outside the Activity Area** | Source/Sink | CO₂  | Project: Estimated based on change in harvested wood volume and default secondary effects value (Section 5.4.3) | If harvesting is reduced in the Activity Area, harvesting on other lands may increase to compensate for the lost production. This "leakage" effect is outlined in Section 5.4.3. |

#### Reforestation
##### Site Preparation
Activities to make conditions in an Activity Area more conducive to tree establishment will have secondary effect emissions associated with them as a result of the mobile combustion of fossil fuels for heavy equipment operation and the removal of shrub biomass. This is calculated where a standard emission factor (1.61), difference between shrub cover as a percent of activity area, and total activity area are multiplied.

##### Biomass Removal
Emissions associated with removal of shrub cover must be integrated. The same equation as the site preparation equation is used, with area replacing the standard emission factor.

##### Leakage
Reforestation, Restoration, Agroforestry, and Silvopastoral activities may result in a shift of grazing or agricultural activities outside the Project Area. This is assessed a single time with results used for the entirety of the project. The decision matrix below is used to define the Leakage Risk Percentage (LR), which is used to define the secondary effects:

![](img/leakage.jpg)

#### IFM
Reduction in harvesting within the activity area could result in increases in harvestin outside. The amount of secondary effects is dependent on how much harvesting occurs on the Activity Area relative to the baseline scenario. 

Harvest levels are assumed to increase through the full project period compared to baseline management because of increased productivity and stocking. Secondary Effects need to be reported every year due to risk that secondary effects may occur at any time.

Secondary effects may be influenced by long term harvesting trends. The evaluation considers how actual cumulative harvest amounts vary from baseline cumulative harvest amounts since activity inception.

##### Harvested Wood Products
A baseline of harvested wood products is developed based on the six years’ worth of harvest data prior to the Activity Area start date. The methodology for estimating the woodproducts CO~2~e baseline is:

![](img/woodproducts.jpg)

The annual report of harvested wood products must also be calculated and compared to the baseline.

### Net GHG Estimation

Following identification of primary and secondary GHG sources, the following 5 steps are used to conservatively estimate GHG removals.

1. **Quantify the Activity Area live and dead standing carbon** - Each reporting period

2. **Determine the Activity Area baseline onsite carbon stocks** - Initial standing carbon stock

::: {.callout-note}
Projects are eligible to receive credits to the extent they increase forest carbon inventories above baseline levels within the Activity Areas.
:::

3. **Calculating the Activity Area Primary Effect** - Each reporting period
    - Quantify actual change in GHG removals by differencing carbon stocks from the previous reporting period, then
    - difference remaining carbon stocks with baseline for previous reporting period

4. **Quantify Activity Area Secondary Effects** - Each reporting period
    - Conservative assessment of whether secondary sources of GHG emissions or removals were quantifiable

5. **Calculating total net GHG removals** - Each reporting period
    - Sum primary and secondary effects 
    - If positive GHG removals are present
    - If negative, there is a potential reversal

This process manifests as the following equation:

![](img/quantify_emissions.jpg)

### Activity Area Baseline

Baselines must be established independently for each activity area. After activity areas pass [additionality criteria](#additionality), the itial baseline is calculated as the sum of carbon (CO~2~e) in the [required carbon pools](#primary-effect-sources-sinks-and-reservoirs) at the start-date.

New activity areas can be added, with new baselines calculated for those areas.

## Permanence

::: {.callout-note}
All credited GHG's must be effectively __"permanent"__ (stored for at least 100 years). Tonne-year accounting principles, as described in Appendix F are used to quantify the time-value of storing carbon as a relative proportion of the 100-year permanence requirement.

Credits are issued based on the proportion of carbon that is stored or secured for the period of time the carbon is committed (e.g. 30 years) relative to the 100-year permanence period.
:::

Projects that commit to maintaining carbon sequestered for a period of time less than 100 years, credits are issued based on the proportion of carbon that is stored or secured for the period of time the carbon is committed relative to the 100-year permanence period.

Mechanisms are used to meet GHG permanence obligations:

1. Legal contracts (e.g. Project Implementation Agreement) / formal commitments (communal/ejidal projects).
    - Commitment to maintain carbon sequestered due to project activities
    - Comply with MRV requirements
2. Buffer Pool insurance based on the projects risk profile
3. Economic incentives including buffer pool dividends for projects with ongoing compliance and maintenance of carbon stocks

### Reversals

If a reversal occurs, credits must be retired to ensure permanence of the CRTs already issued. These are detected during annul monitorign and verification (forest owners / third party verifiers).

1. The release of removal GHG prior to fulfilling its permanence commitment. 
2. If quantified GHG removals are negative for a given period

::: {.callout-note}
**Avoidable Reversals** - the result of negligent human activities.

- Forest Owner must retire credits based on below formula within 2 years, else contract restitution clause is triggered

**Unavoidable Reversals** - the result of natural events (fire, insect mortality, windthrow)

- If Reserve agrees the reversal was unavoidable, credits will be retired from the buffer pool.
- Buffer pool dividends will not be paid until buffer pool credits are restored

**Computational Reversals** - reversal as a result of protocol calculations (e.g. secondary effects)

- Not based on on-the-ground activities, but indicates over-crediting
- Forest owner will "true-up" at next verification by deducting reversed quantity from newly issued credits
    - No growth in that year will result in cancellation of credits from previous vintages
:::

![](img/reversal.jpg)

#### Reversal Example
Most recently issued credits are reversed first, proceeding backwards in time.

A project was credited 100 tonnes of carbon in year 1 and another 50 tonnes in year 2. In year 3, a reversal occurs that releases 75 credits to the atmosphere. The 50 credits issued in year 2 are considered reversed, along with 25 of the credits issued in year 1.

### Buffer Pool

> A general insurance mechanism against reversals. A holding account for credits that is administered by the Reserve. Determined through a project-specific risk assessment.

All projects must contribute a percentage of credits to the buffer pool any time they are issued. Credits are contributed for unavoidable and avoidable reversals. Projects are incentivized with a future stream of credits (dividends) based on compliance.

![](img/buffer_pool.jpg)

::: {.callout-important}
If a reversal lowers the Forest Project’s actual standing live or dead carbon stocks below its approved baseline standing live or dead carbon stocks, the Forest Project will automatically be terminated.

If the Forest Project is terminated due to an Unavoidable Reversal, another project may be initiated and submitted to the Reserve for registration on the same Project Area. New projects may not be initiated on the same Project Area if the Forest Project is terminated due to an Avoidable Reversal.
:::

#### Risk Types

1. **Financial Risk** - Financial failure of an organization resulting in bankruptcy
2. **Management Risk** - risk of management activities that directly or indirectly could lead to a reversal.
    - Illegal Removals of Forest Biomass
    - Conversion of Project Area to Alternative Land Uses
    - Over-Harvesting
3. **Social and Political Risk** - changes in social governance and communal or ejidal acceptance of the project.

::: {.callout-important}
The risks of social actions leading to reversals are significant for ejidos and communities but can be mitigated through actions to ensure ongoing participation and oversight of project benefits.

Social risk are considered to be minimal or private and public lands.
:::

4. **Natural Disturbance Risk**
    - Wildfire, Disease, or Insect Outbreak
    - Other Episodic Catastrophic Events (e.g. Hurricane)

## Verification

Standardized approaches for verification are presented in the [Reserves Verification Program Manual](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/how/verification/verification-program-manual/). 

::: {.callout-important}
Only Reserve-approved Mexico Forest Project verification bodies are eligible to verify Mexico Forest Project reports.

While Forest Owners may depend on consultants or project developers to complete project requirements, responsibility for monitoring reports and verification compliance is assigned to the Forest Owner.
:::

![Verification Timetable](img/verification.jpg)

### Initial Verification

> All Forest Projects must be initially verified within 36 months of their start date.

Must confirm the project’s:
1. Eligibility
2. Compliance with applicable social and environmental safeguards
3. That included Activity Areas’ initial inventory and baseline have been established in conformance with the MFP. 

The verification body must assess and ensure the completeness and accuracy of all required reporting elements for the Project Report (see Section 7.1.2), presented in Table 7.1.

::: {.callout-important}
## Details
### IFM 
Site visit is **mandatory**.

### Reforestation Activities
Site visit **not mandatory**. Can be verified through use of geotagged photos, documented evidence of the purchase or receipt of trees, or through an onsite confirmation.
:::

### Full Verification

> Review of the Forest Project’s eligibility, quantification, and adherence to environmental and social safeguards (if applicable). Requirements vary by activity (i.e., IFM, Reforestation, etc.)

1. Forest Projects not in an Aggregate must undergo a full verification every six reporting periods or in the event of adding a new Activity Area.

::: {.callout-important}
## Details
### IFM 
Site visit is **mandatory** for IFM. Forest Owner and local communituy / ejido can support verification, but verification body should independently take requirement measurements.

### Reforestation Activities
Site visit is **mandatory**. 
:::

### Desk Verification

> Complete verifications for reporting periods in between required full verifications. the verification body must review the data in the annual monitoring reports to check calculations and information for reasonability, accuracy, and completeness.

Answers the question __Is the information presented in annual monitoring reports reasonable?__ by independently comparing:

1. carbon stock changes and increment
2. inventory data and projected growth

::: {.callout-note}
Desk verifications do not include a field inspection of reported data unless the verifier determines a field visit is required to resolve a specific conflict. Any fluctuations must be fully justified.
:::

### Site Visits

Site visits are conducted to verify forest carbon stock and are mandatory for full verifications. 

1. **Sequential sampling** 
    - Sample plots to meet a minimum number of successive plots that indicate agreement.
    - Randomly output plots for sequential sampling
    - Depends on the number of Activity Areas using field sampling inventories comprising the project and/or whether the inventory is stratified
    - Height a diameter sequential sampling - if they match data move on to other plot components
2. **Minimum precision** - +/- 20% at the 90% confidence interval
3. **Measurements** - Fixed area plots
    - DBH
    - Heights 
    - Species
    - Defect / Decay 

### Completing Verification

1. Verification Report delivered to the Forest Owner. 
2. Detailed List of Findings. 
3. Verification Statement detailing vintage and number of GHG removals.
4. Verify that the number of GHG removals, as well as the reversal risk rating, specified in the Verification Report and Statement match the number entered into the Reserve system. 
5. Conduct exit meeting with Forest Owner 
6. With reasonable level of assurance, upload electronic copies of (into the Reserve system):
    - Verification Report
    - List of Findings
    - Verification Statement
    - Optional Verification Activity Log . 
7. Return important records and documents to the Forest Owner.

# Mexican Context

> The communal ownership of the majority of the forests in Mexico by indigenous and/or poor communities is a historical and current issue that must be fully recognized and incorporated into the development of future forest policies and management approaches. In this context, timber management decisions should not depend only on economical or ecological considerations. As forest owners become more knowledgeable about their forests, land use options, and become better organized through proper governance structures, they will become better able to define the best way to manage, not only their forest resources, but all their land resources in a broader context of overall sustainable development. - @torres2016sustainable

* Timber management in Mexico is practiced on communal and private forest lands.

* Often a seasonal activity with low returns, struggling to compete with cheaper imported timber products.

* Timber market has shrunk over the last 15 years
    * Reduction the number of lumber mills and investment in logging technology.

* Generally no tradition of making a living from cultivating and investing in forests among forest community inhabitants.

* Many inhabitants of forest areas live in extreme poverty.
    * Poor health education, and accessibility conditions

* Few incentives exist to invest in low-impact harvest methods.
    * Only rare high-grade logs or sawnwood and logs of precious species remain competitive.

* Forests play an increasingly important role in:
    * climate change mitigation
    * attracting forest landuse players
    * conservation alternatives

* Alternatives like REDD+ incentives or carbon sequestration markets **can be more profitable than timber extraction for forests with __low productivity or high biodiversity.__**

* New markets impact timber management decisions, potentially delaying or reducing harvest levels.

::: {.callout-note}
## Relvance for communally owned forests
Alternatives are appealing for areas with traditionally high timber production and administration costs, such as communally owned forests.
:::

* Common management actions include:
    * reducing harvest areas
    * harvest volumes
    * delaying harvests
    * changing silvicultural systems.

* complexity of managing diverse forest compositions and rapidly changing site conditions complicates planning and operational practices.

### Community Forest Enterprises

::: {.callout-tip}
Communal forests under active timber management operate as Community Forest Enterprises (CFEs).
:::

* CFEs produce almost 85% of the timber volume logged in the country.

* Objectives in CFEs extend beyond profit maximization, including:
    * community wellbeing
    * job creation
    * conservation of special places
    * species conservation
    * promotion of diverse economic activities.

* CFEs are responsible for protecting, restoring, harvesting, logging, and industrializing forest lands.

* Tend to have lower timber harvest levels due to broader community goals.

#### Topical Forests

* The _Plan Piloto Forestal de Quintana Roo (PPF)_ was created as part of the transition to new forest management methods.

* PPF incorporates the management of more species, restricts harvest levels to estimated current growth, and designates permanent conservation areas.

* PPF harvest levels are based on estimates of growth and size distribution of valuable species.

* Forest sustainability under PPF relies on accurate estimates, demand for diverse species, and high investments for species regeneration.

* PPF is recognized as a major, successful tropical forest management operation in Latin America.

#### Tropical Dry Forests

* Tropical dry forests have been severely impacted by land use changes due to ease of conversion and higher soil fertility.

* Sustainable harvest level estimation procedures are basic due to limited knowledge of species dynamics.

* The goal is to maintain specific forest structures and species diversity between cutting cycles.

* Transition matrices of species numbers and tree-diameter distribution are used to determine species abundance and estimate harvest levels.

* Harvest decisions depend on estimates of tree additions to each diameter class and the ratio between this ingrowth and the next higher diameter class.
