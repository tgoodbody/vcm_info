Legal - GHG removals must be greater than that required by any applicable laws/rules/statutes.\n    - IFM - Demonstrate that actual forest growth exceeds allowable harvest from a management plan. Any non-harvested periodic growth is addtional.\n    - Reforestation - Was not forest within past 5 years\n    - Restoration - Risk to forest inventories are present at considerable levels\n\n2.
