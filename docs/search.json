Exceptions may be granted by the Reserve.\n\n\nES2 Native Species\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation\nMust demonstrate progress towards achieving 95% native species within the Activity Areas. Use of native species outside historic range allowed if used as climate change adaptation strategy with SEMARNAT office approval.  - IFM/Restoration: 50 years  - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment.\n\n\nES3 Composition of Native Species\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation\nMust demonstrate progress towards meeting native species composition according to Table 3.3. Exceptions allowed with regional SEMARNAT or CONABIO approval.  - IFM/Restoration: 50 years  - Reforestation: immediately after forest stand establishment.\n\n\nES4 Maintenance or increase of tree canopy cover\nIFM, Restoration, Reforestation, Agroforestry, Silvopastoral\nTree canopy cover must not decrease due to human activities. Verify at 6th reporting period. Decline &gt;5% due to negligence results in corrective action. Approved activities planned by government agencies are exempt.\n\n\nES5 Sustainable harvesting practices\nIFM\nHarvest areas &gt;5 hectares must retain 10% of trees in groups no further than 100 meters from other trees. Retained trees not felled until 10 years old. Exceptions require prior written request approval.\n\n\nES6 Maintenance of natural land cover\nReforestation\nConsider effects on ecological processes. Provide justification for activities impacting natural land cover for Reserve approval.\n\n\nES7 Soil disturbance during site preparation for tree planting\nAll\nSite preparation using deep ripping prohibited from affecting &gt;1% of Activity Area. If exceeded, reporting for the Activity Area is suspended for three periods.  Example: Deep ripping on 100-hectare area affects 22,000 meters with tine width of 0.1 meters, affecting 2.24% of area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nActivty area size determines native species composition requirments:\n\n10ha - single species allowed\n10-50ha - 90% single species\n50-100ha - 80% single species, 2 other species required\n100-1000ha - 70% single species, 3 other species required\n&gt; 1000ha - 60% single species, 4 other species required\n\n\n\n\nForest Types\n\nNatural forest and shrub land cover (bosque, selva, zonas áridas) are where dominant overstory vegetation is comprised of an overwhelming majority of native species, i.e., greater than 70% by CO2e stocking.\nNatural grassland areas are where grassland plant communities (native or non-native species) exist due to natural environmental features (soil conditions, precipitation, etc.) and/or natural frequency of disturbance events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the grasslands must be constantly grazed or burned more frequently than would be the case in a natural ecosystem, the grasslands would not meet the definition of natural.\n\n\n\nWetlands are considered natural wherever they are found not being used for agriculture or intensive aquaculture and not part of a non-natural waterbody.\n\n\n\n\nStart Date\nThe project start date cannot be more than 1 year prior to the submittal date and must be able to demonstrate project activities initiated on the claimed date through verifiable action or event. Permissable actions include:\n\nAn Assembly where commencent of training or analysis for the project were approved - provided to the verifier with an official Assembly Act form, meeting notes, agenda.\nProject submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAddition of subsequent Activity Areas is based on official approval and inclusion of these areas in the annual MRV documents.\n\n\n\n\nCrediting Period\nTwo crediting period lengths (durability commitments) are permitted:\n\n30 Years\n100 Years\n\nProjects with a 30-year crediting pecriod that have met all Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirements and maintained legal compliance throughout their first crediting period, can extend the crediting period for another 30-year period using the baseline developed for the initial crediting period.\n\nMinimum Time Commitment\nProjects must commit to maintaining carbon sequestered due to project activities for a minimum period of 30 years up to the Reserve’s 100-year permanence requirement. However, for projects that commit to a period less than 100 years, credits will be issued in an amount proportionate to the length of the commitment relative to 100 years."

This “leakage” effect is outlined in Section 5.4.3.\n\n\n\n\nReforestation\n\nSite Preparation\nActivities to make conditions in an Activity Area more conducive to tree establishment will have secondary effect emissions associated with them as a result of the mobile combustion of fossil fuels for heavy equipment operation and the removal of shrub biomass. This is calculated where a standard emission factor (1.61), difference between shrub cover as a percent of activity area, and total activity area are multiplied.\n\n\nBiomass Removal\nEmissions associated with removal of shrub cover must be integrated. The same equation as the site preparation equation is used, with area replacing the standard emission factor.\n\n\nLeakage\nReforestation, Restoration, Agroforestry, and Silvopastoral activities may result in a shift of grazing or agricultural activities outside the Project Area. This is assessed a single time with results used for the entirety of the project. The decision matrix below is used to define the Leakage Risk Percentage (LR), which is used to define the secondary effects:\n\n\n\n\nIFM\nReduction in harvesting within the activity area could result in increases in harvestin outside. The amount of secondary effects is dependent on how much harvesting occurs on the Activity Area relative to the baseline scenario.\nHarvest levels are assumed to increase through the full project period compared to baseline management because of increased productivity and stocking. Secondary Effects need to be reported every year due to risk that secondary effects may occur at any time.\nSecondary effects may be influenced by long term harvesting trends. The evaluation considers how actual cumulative harvest amounts vary from baseline cumulative harvest amounts since activity inception.\n\nHarvested Wood Products\nA baseline of harvested wood products is developed based on the six years’ worth of harvest data prior to the Activity Area start date. The methodology for estimating the woodproducts CO2e baseline is:\n\nThe annual report of harvested wood products must also be calculated and compared to the baseline.\n\n\n\n\nNet GHG Estimation\nFollowing identification of primary and secondary GHG sources, the following 5 steps are used to conservatively estimate GHG removals.\n\nQuantify the Activity Area live and dead standing carbon - Each reporting period\nDetermine the Activity Area baseline onsite carbon stocks - Initial standing carbon stock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProjects are eligible to receive credits to the extent they increase forest carbon inventories above baseline levels within the Activity Areas.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Activity Area Primary Effect - Each reporting period\n\nQuantify actual change in GHG removals by differencing carbon stocks from the previous reporting period, then\ndifference remaining carbon stocks with baseline for previous reporting period\n\nQuantify Activity Area Secondary Effects - Each reporting period\n\nConservative assessment of whether secondary sources of GHG emissions or removals were quantifiable\n\nCalculating total net GHG removals - Each reporting period\n\nSum primary and secondary effects\nIf positive GHG removals are present\nIf negative, there is a potential reversal\n\n\nThis process manifests as the following equation:\n\n\n\nActivity Area Baseline\nBaselines must be established independently for each activity area. After activity areas pass additionality criteria, the itial baseline is calculated as the sum of carbon (CO2e) in the required carbon pools at the start-date.\nNew activity areas can be added, with new baselines calculated for those areas."

Tonne-year accounting principles, as described in Appendix F are used to quantify the time-value of storing carbon as a relative proportion of the 100-year permanence requirement.\nCredits are issued based on the proportion of carbon that is stored or secured for the period of time the carbon is committed (e.g. 30 years) relative to the 100-year permanence period.\n\n\nProjects that commit to maintaining carbon sequestered for a period of time less than 100 years, credits are issued based on the proportion of carbon that is stored or secured for the period of time the carbon is committed relative to the 100-year permanence period.\nMechanisms are used to meet GHG permanence obligations:\n\nLegal contracts (e.g. Project Implementation Agreement) / formal commitments (communal/ejidal projects).\n\nCommitment to maintain carbon sequestered due to project activities\nComply with MRV requirements\n\nBuffer Pool insurance based on the projects risk profile\nEconomic incentives including buffer pool dividends for projects with ongoing compliance and maintenance of carbon stocks\n\n\nReversals\nIf a reversal occurs, credits must be retired to ensure permanence of the CRTs already issued.

In year 3, a reversal occurs that releases 75 credits to the atmosphere. The 50 credits issued in year 2 are considered reversed, along with 25 of the credits issued in year 1.\n\n\n\nBuffer Pool\n\nA general insurance mechanism against reversals. A holding account for credits that is administered by the Reserve. Determined through a project-specific risk assessment.\n\nAll projects must contribute a percentage of credits to the buffer pool any time they are issued. Credits are contributed for unavoidable and avoidable reversals. Projects are incentivized with a future stream of credits (dividends) based on compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf a reversal lowers the Forest Project’s actual standing live or dead carbon stocks below its approved baseline standing live or dead carbon stocks, the Forest Project will automatically be terminated.\nIf the Forest Project is terminated due to an Unavoidable Reversal, another project may be initiated and submitted to the Reserve for registration on the same Project Area. New projects may not be initiated on the same Project Area if the Forest Project is terminated due to an Avoidable Reversal.\n\n\n\nRisk Types\n\nFinancial Risk - Financial failure of an organization resulting in bankruptcy\nManagement Risk - risk of management activities that directly or indirectly could lead to a reversal.\n\nIllegal Removals of Forest Biomass\nConversion of Project Area to Alternative Land Uses\nOver-Harvesting\n\nSocial and Political Risk - changes in social governance and communal or ejidal acceptance of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe risks of social actions leading to reversals are significant for ejidos and communities but can be mitigated through actions to ensure ongoing participation and oversight of project benefits.\nSocial risk are considered to be minimal or private and public lands.\n\n\n\nNatural Disturbance Risk\n\nWildfire, Disease, or Insect Outbreak\nOther Episodic Catastrophic Events (e.g. Hurricane)"

Eligibility 2. Compliance with applicable social and environmental safeguards 3. That included Activity Areas’ initial inventory and baseline have been established in conformance with the MFP.\nThe verification body must assess and ensure the completeness and accuracy of all required reporting elements for the Project Report (see Section 7.1.2), presented in Table 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nIFM\nSite visit is mandatory.\n\n\nReforestation Activities\nSite visit not mandatory. Can be verified through use of geotagged photos, documented evidence of the purchase or receipt of trees, or through an onsite confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Verification\n\nReview of the Forest Project’s eligibility, quantification, and adherence to environmental and social safeguards (if applicable). Requirements vary by activity (i.e., IFM, Reforestation, etc.)\n\n\nForest Projects not in an Aggregate must undergo a full verification every six reporting periods or in the event of adding a new Activity Area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nIFM\nSite visit is mandatory for IFM. Forest Owner and local communituy / ejido can support verification, but verification body should independently take requirement measurements.\n\n\nReforestation Activities\nSite visit is mandatory.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesk Verification\n\nComplete verifications for reporting periods in between required full verifications. the verification body must review the data in the annual monitoring reports to check calculations and information for reasonability, accuracy, and completeness.\n\nAnswers the question Is the information presented in annual monitoring reports reasonable? by independently comparing:\n\ncarbon stock changes and increment\ninventory data and projected growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDesk verifications do not include a field inspection of reported data unless the verifier determines a field visit is required to resolve a specific conflict. Any fluctuations must be fully justified.\n\n\n\n\nSite Visits\nSite visits are conducted to verify forest carbon stock and are mandatory for full verifications.\n\nSequential sampling\n\nSample plots to meet a minimum number of successive plots that indicate agreement.\nRandomly output plots for sequential sampling\nDepends on the number of Activity Areas using field sampling inventories comprising the project and/or whether the inventory is stratified\nHeight a diameter sequential sampling - if they match data move on to other plot components\n\nMinimum precision - +/- 20% at the 90% confidence interval\nMeasurements - Fixed area plots\n\nDBH\nHeights\nSpecies\nDefect / Decay\n\n\n\n\nCompleting Verification\n\nVerification Report delivered to the Forest Owner.\nDetailed List of Findings.\nVerification Statement detailing vintage and number of GHG removals.\nVerify that the number of GHG removals, as well as the reversal risk rating, specified in the Verification Report and Statement match the number entered into the Reserve system.\nConduct exit meeting with Forest Owner\nWith reasonable level of assurance, upload electronic copies of (into the Reserve system):\n\nVerification Report\nList of Findings\nVerification Statement\nOptional Verification Activity Log .\n\nReturn important records and documents to the Forest Owner."
