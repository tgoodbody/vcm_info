## Project Overview

![](img/project_workflow.jpg)

__Forest Project__: a planned set of defined activities designed to increase removals of CO2e from the atmosphere through increasing forest carbon stocks on the communal lands of ejidos or communities, private lands, or public lands.

__Project Area__: all areas within an ownership, held either communally, privately, or publicly, in which project activities within _Activity Areas_ may occur as part of the project, currently or in the future.

* Communally owned lands - PA must include all communcal ownership at project start.
* _dominio pleno_ (full ownership rights) parcels should be excluded from PA
* _ejidial_ (communal) parcels converted to _dominio pleno_ should be removed and project re-verified
* Define boundaries using a high resolution map that includes
    * major towns, roads, water
    * Geospatial file (`.shp`,`.kml`,`.geojson`)

## Activities

Mexico Forest Protocol will register activities for sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks, adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

:::{.callout-note}
Management actions may change over the course of the Activity Area’s life, the activity designation is based on the activity definition that is met at the Activity Area’s initiation.

### Documentation

![](img/document_requirements.jpg)

### Forest Owner
Forest owners are the entity that has undisputed legal ownership of or jurisdiction over the forest carbon through outright ownership or through rights granted to them from a state or federal entity

The forest owner is responsible for undertaking a forest project and registering the project with CAR, and for all reporting. They can consult a project developer to assist with project implementation, but are ultuimately responsible for the project's accuracy and completeness.

::: {.callout-note}
Ownership can be private, communal (e.g. ejidos), or public.

#### Attestations

1. **Attestation of title** must be formally provided to indicate that the owner has exclusive owenership claim to the GHG removals achived by their project over the verification period.

2. **Attestation of No Conflicts** must be formally provided prior to each verification declaring that there are no disputes, claims, or lawsuits related to the property.

For all ejidos and communities, the Forest Owner must submit a document produced by the Agrarian Attorney (Procuraduría Agraria) that states that there are no agrarian conflicts within the Activity Areas as part of the Project Report.

3. **Attestation of Regulatory Compliance** must be signed prior to each verification to indicate that the proejct is in complieance with laws, bylaws, regulations and norms relavant to the project activity.

### Project Developer

A project developer may be the Forest Owner or an independent third-party contracted by the Forest Owner to assist the Forest Owner and implement the Forest Project. Non compliance must be delared in writing - Climate reserve tonnes (credits) will not be issued for GHG removals that occurred for the monitoring period in which the material non-compliance occurred

### Aggregation

The goal of aggregation is to alleviate transaction costs for individual landowners and maintain standards and high-quality offsets. The aggregator may be a corporation or other legally constituted entity, city, county, state agency, individual or a combination thereof, which may then submit documentation on behalf of Aggregate participants (two or more Forest Owners).

Individual project activities can be combined with others to reduce administrative costs, improve marketing opportunities, and enable economies of scale.

::: {.callout-note}
An Aggregate is two or more individual Forest Projects and may be composed of any combination of eligible Forest Owners from any geographic location within Mexico.
:::

Aggregation only applies to:

* Projects with < 10,000 ha of activity areas
* Individual registration and signatory must be performed, including buffer pool assessments.
* Reversal liability lies with individual forest owners

### Social Safeguards

Forest Projects can create long-term climate benefits as well as other social and environmental benefits. Investment into forest carbon projects has the potential to improve quality of life for rural communities, both in terms of increased revenues and in terms of sustaining and improving forest ecosystems.

The social safeguard requirements for ejidos and communities include: 

1. [Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}
    - Make information available to the community about holding an assembly (highest ejido/community body where decisions are made) to discuss social safeguards

::: {.callout-note}
Activty area size determines native species composition requirments:

*   10ha - single species allowed
*   10-50ha - 90% single species 
*   50-100ha - 80% single species, 2 other species required
*   100-1000ha - 70% single species, 3 other species required
*   \> 1000ha - 60% single species, 4 other species required 
:::

#### Forest Types

1. **Natural forest and shrub land cover (bosque, selva, zonas áridas)** are where dominant overstory vegetation is comprised of an overwhelming majority of native species, i.e., greater than 70% by CO2e stocking.
2. **Natural grassland areas** are where grassland plant communities (native or non-native species) exist due to natural environmental features (soil conditions, precipitation, etc.) and/or natural frequency of disturbance events. 

::: {.callout-note}
If the grasslands must be constantly grazed or burned more frequently than would be the case in a natural ecosystem, the grasslands would not meet the definition of natural.
:::

3. **Wetlands** are considered natural wherever they are found not being used for agriculture or intensive aquaculture and not part of a non-natural waterbody.

### Start Date

The project start date cannot be more than 1 year prior to the submittal date and must be able to demonstrate project activities initiated on the claimed date through verifiable action or event. Permissable actions include:

1. An Assembly where commencent of training or analysis for the project were approved - provided to the verifier with an official Assembly Act form, meeting notes, agenda.
2. Project submission

::: {.callout-note}
Addition of subsequent Activity Areas is based on official approval and inclusion of these areas in the annual MRV documents.
:::

### Crediting Period

Two crediting period lengths (durability commitments) are permitted:

1. 30 Years
2. 100 Years

Projects with a 30-year crediting pecriod that have met all Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirements and maintained legal compliance throughout their first crediting period, can extend the crediting period for another 30-year period using the baseline developed for the initial crediting period.

#### Minimum Time Commitment
Projects must commit to maintaining carbon sequestered due to project activities for a minimum period of 30 years up to the Reserve’s 100-year permanence requirement. However, for projects that commit to a period less than 100 years, credits will be issued in an amount proportionate to the length of the commitment relative to 100 years.

## Additionality

Projects must yield GHG removals that are determined to be additonal to what would have opccured in the absense of a project.Projects must pass the following 2 tests to be considered additional:

1. Legal - GHG removals must be greater than that required by any applicable laws/rules/statutes.
    - IFM - Demonstrate that actual forest growth exceeds allowable harvest from a management plan. Any non-harvested periodic growth is addtional.
    - Reforestation - Was not forest within past 5 years
    - Restoration - Risk to forest inventories are present at considerable levels

2. Performance Standard - GHG removals must be greater than buisiness as usual activities

Direct/indirect investments are required for a project to be considered additional:

1. Reforestation/Agroforestry
    - Direct - labour / capital (seedlings, planting, planning, site prep.)
    - Indirect - protecting established stands from herbivory, land conversion to grazing / agrilculture
2. IFM / Urban forestry
    - Direct - stockign improvements, opportunty costs assocaited with extended rotations
    - Indirect - protection of stands from biotic/abiotic/manmade risks (e.g. illegal harvest)
