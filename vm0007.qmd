# Overview

Allows project developers to combine **modules** and **tools** that define project activity and methodological steps.

**Historical Refernce Period**: Period of time during which factors must be considered in order to maake future projections of deforestation (see VCS Methodology Requirements)

**Project crediting period**: Period of rtime for which GHG emission reductions or removals generated by the proejct ar eligible for crediting.

* Between 20-100 years for Ag, forestry, other land use (AFOLU)

## Eligibility

### Activities

* Avoiding planned deforestation (APD)

    * Conversion of forest land is legally permitted

* Avoiding unplanned deforestation (AUD)

    *   Clear land for harvest, settlement, crop production/ raching

    *   No documented and uncontested legal right to deforest

    *   Residents of reference region for deforestation or immigrants

* Afforestation, redforestation and revegetation (ARR)
    * Part or all land must be non-forest or degraded and unmanaged

    * Cannot be cleared for GHG emissions reduction/removals

::: {.callout-note}
## ARR Cannot:

* use nitrogen fertilizers

* enhance peat oxidation

:::

* Conservation of intact wetlands (planned/unplanned)

* Restoring wetlands

::: {.callout-important}
Improved Forest Management is not covered by this methodology.
:::

### Activity Areas

Can include areas subject to different activities - must be indepenent. REstoring wetlands and ARR can be combined.

* Land in project area must be forest
    * Mangroves not subject to height requirements

### Project Boundary

The following categories of boundaries must be defined:

#### Geographic & temporal boundaries

* Boundaries are fixed. Cannot eb change over the project lifetime.

* Boundary must bne clealy defined to enable MRV.

* Can be **independent** parcels of land (doenst need to be a single area)

* Must present:
    * Name of project area
    * ID for each parcel
    * Map of area
    * Coodrinates of each polygon
    * Total land area
    * Landholder and user rights documents

* Cannot include other areas under GHG projects

#### REDD Boundaries

* Only land that has been forest for at least 10 years

* AUD must have
    * proejct area and proxy areas

* APD must have
    * Project area
    * Reference Region
    * leakage belt





* Carbon pools the project considers

* Sources and types of GHG emissions that the project will affect
